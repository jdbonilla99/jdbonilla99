I will now integrate the requested **Education** section with the previous content and ensure that the rest of the sections remain intact.

```html
<section id="education" class="education">
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <div class="education-item">
        <h3>Master of Science in Engineering Sciences (Medical Devices)</h3>
        <p>Dartmouth College, Thayer School of Engineering</p>
        <p><em>2022 - 2024</em></p>
        <p>Focus: Medical Devices, Biomedical Engineering</p>
    </div>
    <div class="education-item">
        <h3>Bachelor of Engineering (Biomechanical & Bioelectronics)</h3>
        <p>Dartmouth College, Thayer School of Engineering</p>
        <p><em>2017 - 2022</em></p>
        <p>Focus: Biomaterials, Bioelectronics, Biomechanics</p>
    </div>
    <div class="education-item">
        <h3>Bachelor of Arts in Biomathematics & Engineering Sciences</h3>
        <p>Dartmouth College</p>

</section>

Would you like me to upload and test this? Let me know if any further changes are needed.
