    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a researcher with an MS in Engineering Sciences (Medical Devices) from the Thayer School of Engineering. I was a former King Scholar at Dartmouth College, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Biomathematics and Engineering and a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Biomaterials and Bioelectronics. My interests lie in design, health, and the intersection of technology and poverty alleviation.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy Enhancement with Gold Nanoparticles</h3>
        <p>This project aimed to improve the treatment of pancreatic cancer using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to enhance radiation therapy. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat and often unresponsive to conventional therapies due to late detection and poor prognosis. The approach involved functionalizing gold nanoparticles with P1G4 antibodies to target pancreatic tumor cells. The gold nanoparticles serve as radiosensitizers, increasing the radiation dose to tumor cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. This novel treatment could potentially improve survival rates for pancreatic cancer patients and reduce side effects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Calculator Project (Basys 3 FPGA-Based)</h3>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a calculator that could perform mathematical operations using a Basys 3 board and a computer keyboard. It successfully performed addition of two-digit numbers, displaying results on a 7-segment display. The calculator was developed using VHDL code and FPGA hardware, with careful synchronization of signals. The final product allowed for adding another number to a previous result and clearing the display. Key improvements for future versions include better timing and expanded functionality for additional operations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Bottles, Bins, and Beyond (Recycling Contamination Reduction)</h3>
        <p>This project addressed the contamination problem in recycling systems by designing a bin that separates contaminated and non-contaminated beverage containers. Our solution uses a gravity-based trapdoor mechanism that triggers based on the weight of the container to classify bottles for disposal or recycling. This energy-efficient system helps reduce contamination fines and was designed to be user-friendly with no manual intervention required. The project was created for Dartmouth College dining facilities and has potential for broader implementation in high-traffic areas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Sweat-Based Glucose Monitor</h3>
        <p>This project focused on designing a non-invasive glucose monitoring device that uses sweat instead of blood to measure glucose levels. The monitor employs glucose oxidase enzymes and platinum nanoparticles to detect glucose, providing an accessible, affordable solution for patients in low-resource settings. Our work aimed to optimize the accuracy of sweat glucose metrics and develop a product that could be distributed at a low cost for use in third-world populations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Point-of-Care Cervical Cancer Screening Device</h3>
        <p>We developed a point-of-care device to improve cervical cancer screening in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The device is based on microfluidic technology and optimized to work with limited healthcare infrastructure, offering quick results with minimal professional involvement. Our work tackled the high incidence of cervical cancer in LMICs by creating an affordable, user-friendly solution that facilitates early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>Arm Prostheses for Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)</h3>
        <p>This project aimed to design functional, low-cost arm prostheses for amputees in LMICs, particularly focusing on Honduras. Using 3D printing and affordable materials like polypropylene and thermoplastics, we developed prostheses that are tailored to individual needs and capable of restoring basic arm functions. The prostheses were designed to be lightweight, durable, and easy to manufacture in resource-constrained environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-item">
        <h3>NiFe Permanent Magnets for Electric Motors and Turbines</h3>
        <p>In this project, I investigated the performance of new NiFe permanent magnets for potential use in electric motors and wind turbines. Through various thermal and mechanical treatments, we tested different formulations to assess their magnetic properties and optimize their efficiency for industrial applications. Our findings showed promise for future large-scale implementations of these high-performance materials.</p>
