    <ul>
        <li><strong>Laparoscopic Probe for Prostate Cancer Margin Detection:</strong> Developed a laparoscopic bioimpedance probe designed to detect positive surgical margins in prostate cancer patients during laparoscopic prostatectomy. Positive margins, or diseased tissue left after surgery, often lead to the need for additional procedures such as further surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. This probe provides real-time feedback to the surgeon regarding tissue status, reducing the likelihood of leaving positive margins and decreasing postoperative complications. The device integrates a bioimpedance sensor to differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissue, improving surgical accuracy and outcomes in prostate cancer patients.</li>

        <li><strong>3D-Printed Arm Prostheses for LMICs:</strong> Designed affordable, functional arm prostheses for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a focus on regions such as Honduras. Using 3D printing technology and inexpensive materials like polypropylene and thermoplastics, the prostheses offer a customizable solution to individuals with arm amputations. The project emphasized cost-efficiency, ease of manufacturing, and durability to meet the specific needs of LMIC communities.</li>

        <li><strong>Point-of-Care Cervical Cancer HPV Screening Device:</strong> Developed a low-cost, point-of-care device aimed at improving cervical cancer screening, particularly in low-resource settings. The device utilizes a microfluidic platform to detect the presence of high-risk HPV strains, which are major contributors to cervical cancer. Designed for use in clinics with limited laboratory access, the device offers rapid results, aiding early diagnosis and reducing mortality rates in low- and middle-income countries.</li>

        <li><strong>ENGS 31 UART Calculator Project:</strong> This project involved the development of a UART-based calculator using a Basys 3 board and a PS/2 keyboard. The calculator accepts keyboard inputs for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, displaying results on a 7-segment display. The primary focus was to implement UART communication protocols, hardware design, and signal processing using FPGA technology.</li>

        <li><strong>ENGS 33 Bridge Design Project:</strong> Designed a truss bridge as part of a solid mechanics course to test structural efficiency and material usage. This project focused on using wood as the primary material, analyzing the strength-to-weight ratio and optimizing design for rural construction. The bridge was tested for maximum load-bearing capacity while maintaining low cost and easy assembly.</li>

        <li><strong>Bottles, Bins, and Beyond (Recycling Contamination Reduction):</strong> Developed a recycling bin system aimed at reducing contamination in beverage container recycling. The bin uses a gravity-based trapdoor mechanism to differentiate between contaminated and uncontaminated containers based on weight. The system was designed to be energy-efficient and automated, reducing fines and improving recycling efficiency in public spaces such as schools and cafeterias.</li>

        <li><strong>Gold Nanoparticle-Enhanced Radiation Therapy for Cancer:</strong> Developed a novel treatment for pancreatic cancer using gold nanoparticles functionalized with P1G4 antibodies. These nanoparticles target pancreatic tumors and enhance the effects of radiation therapy by localizing radiation doses and amplifying biological effects, leading to a sixfold increase in effectiveness compared to traditional radiation treatments. This method shows potential not only for pancreatic cancer but also for other solid tumors, offering a promising new option for cancer treatment.</li>

        <li><strong>NiFe Permanent Magnets for Electric Motors and Turbines:</strong> Investigated the properties of NiFe (Nickel-Iron) permanent magnets for potential applications in electric motors and wind turbines. The project involved optimizing the composition and manufacturing process to improve the magnetic properties and energy efficiency of the magnets. These magnets hold promise for large-scale implementation in renewable energy applications, offering a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to traditional magnets.</li>

        <li><strong>Sweat-Based Glucose Monitor:</strong> Developed a non-invasive glucose monitoring device that uses sweat as a medium to measure glucose levels, eliminating the need for blood samples. The device employs glucose oxidase and platinum nanoparticles for electrochemical detection of glucose, providing an accessible solution for patients with diabetes. This project focused on affordability and ease of use, making it suitable for low-resource settings and providing a less invasive option for glucose monitoring.</li>
